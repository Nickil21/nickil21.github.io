    Objective was to predict toxicity for 6 different languages given a dataset consisting of only English comments from the previous two jigsaw competitions. 
    Needing to use TPUs to even have the ability to train massive models and the validation set having only 3 languages to evaluate locally made it really challenging.

    Objective was to develop a robust model to predict Free Lime. What makes this challenge interesting was the small 
    size of the train/test split (~5K/1K rows) which makes it prone to overfitting, presence of several outliers in 
    the dependent variable, and two level evaluation criteria (Mean Absolute Error + R squared) to judge the Private LB.

    Measuring poverty is hard. The World Bank can now build on open source machine learning tools to help predict poverty, 
    optimize uses of survey data, and support work to end extreme poverty in the next decade.
