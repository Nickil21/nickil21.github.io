I explore the [Red Hen Rapid Annotator tool](https://beta.rapidannotator.org/) which currently supports manual and spreadsheet inputted data. Each video from the 30 total videos is segmented for every 5 seconds from the Ellen interview dataset and its speech transcription is stored locally for every chunk. I create labels for gesture categories and gesture types for the chosen 4 hand gesture types.
